    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <strong>Hello There.</strong>


    <p1>My name is Deadpool, and since I'm fired from Marvel Studios aka better DC Comics, I'm looking for a new job. 
    	I know I'm unethical and I do have short temper, but I have a lot to offer you, mostly something not useful. So it would be great 
    	if you consider me as your new babysitter. Thx!</p1>

    <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

    <strong>I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money... but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it - I will not look for you, I will not pursue you... but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you... and I will kill you.</strong>
